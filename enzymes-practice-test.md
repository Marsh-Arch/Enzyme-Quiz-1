### Section B: Short Answer (Sample Answers)

31. **Six enzyme classes:**
- Oxidoreductases: catalyze oxidation-reduction (e.g., dehydrogenases)
- Transferases: transfer chemical groups (e.g., ALT, AST)
- Hydrolases: cleave with water addition (e.g., lipase)
- Lyases: cleave without hydrolysis (e.g., decarboxylase)
- Isomerases: rearrange molecules (e.g., isomerases)
- Ligases: join two molecules (e.g., synthetases)

32. **Enzyme components:**
- Apoenzyme: protein part of conjugated enzyme
- Prosthetic group: tightly bound non-protein part
- Holoenzyme: complete enzyme (apoenzyme + prosthetic group/coenzyme)

33. **Enzyme mechanism:**
Enzymes lower activation energy by stabilizing the transition state of the enzyme-substrate complex, making it easier for reactants to reach the activated state needed for reaction to proceed.

34. **Inhibition comparison:**
- Competitive: inhibitor competes with substrate for active site; can be reversed by increasing substrate; Km increases, Vmax unchanged
- Noncompetitive: inhibitor binds elsewhere; cannot be reversed by substrate; Km unchanged, Vmax decreases

35. **Factors affecting enzyme rate:**
- Substrate concentration
- Enzyme concentration  
- Temperature
- pH
- Coenzyme concentration
- Metal ion activator concentration

36. **Regulation vs Inhibition:**
- Feedback regulation: end product decreases enzyme synthesis at gene level (long-term, hours-days)
- Feedback inhibition: end product directly inhibits enzyme activity (short-term, seconds-minutes)

37. **Proenzyme importance:**
- Protect tissues from auto-digestion
- Allow rapid enzyme activation when needed

38. **Metal-containing enzymes:**
- Metalloenzymes: require metal as part of structure
- Metal-activated: have lower affinity but still need metal for activity

39. **Coenzyme types:**
- Co-dehydrogenases: carry H⁺ in oxidation-reduction (e.g., NAD, FAD)
- Group-transferring: transfer chemical groups other than H⁺ (e.g., CoA, PLP)

40. **LDH clinical significance:**
Different isoenzymes indicate tissue damage:
- LDH1,2: myocardial infarction
- LDH3: leukemia  
- LDH4,5: viral hepatitis
